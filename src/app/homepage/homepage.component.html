      <h5 class="card-title">Ratnapura Floods</h5>
      <p class="card-text">
        Torrential rains between the 11th and 19th May 2003, affected the
        southern districts of Ratnapura, Matara, Hambantota, Kaluthara and
        Galle. This was the worst natural disaster in 50 years in Sri Lanka.
        Floods and landslides claimed 260 lives and destroyed schools, homes and
        other infrastructure. Floodwaters have been from 5 to 20 feet deep
        (higher than many rural houses). Many buildings had been submerged,
        particularly in the Ratnapura district, where the cityâ€™s clock tower was
        reported to be under 15 feet of water. The majority of homeless were
        also located in the Ratnapura district. Forty-seven bodies were
        recovered from one village after a landslide wiped out the entire
        village. About 180,000 people had their homes damaged or destroyed, with
        about 700 missing persons and over 129,000 families displaced. Some
        120,000 people had been evacuated to schools and temples, and
        helicopters were dropping emergency rations in villages that were cut
        off and cannot be reached.
